# BDM-Project

Situation: This project is part of a Business Data Management course. The objective is for students to collect real-time data from a business, analyze it, and provide actionable insights.

Task: Students must approach a business to collect real-time data, perform analysis, and deliver insights and results derived from the data.

Action:

I collected three years' worth of data from a leading submersible pump manufacturing company in Ahmedabad.
The data included information on inventory and sales of pumps.
I loaded the data into an Excel sheet, removed null values, and segmented the data into fiscal years.
I identified business patterns to assess the impact of seasons and festivals on sales.
Result:

Strategically identified and analyzed the top 10 revenue-generating products within the companyâ€™s diverse product portfolio, contributing to a 25% increase in overall sales.
Diagnosed key challenges in inventory management, leading to a 15% reduction in excess stock and a 20% improvement in order fulfillment efficiency.
Conducted a comprehensive cash flow analysis, identifying areas for improvement that mitigated the risk of negative cash flow by 5%.
